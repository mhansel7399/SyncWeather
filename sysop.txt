--------------------

I) Getting a Wunderground API Key

You can get your API key for WeatherAPI.com here: https://www.weatherapi.com/signup.aspx

--------------------

II) External Program Configuration

Setting up the Weather App (weather.js):

1: If you downloaded this as a ZIP file, extract the files to a folder in your /sbbs/xtrn/ directory. This doc assumes you named the
   folder "syncWX" (ie. /sbbs/xtrn/syncWX/). If you are going to have it show up on logon, create another folder "syncWXL" (ie. /sbbs/xtrn/syncWXL/).

2: Add the following section to your ctrl/modopts.ini file (typically located at /sbbs/ctrl/modopts.ini):

[syncWX]
wungrndAPIkey = <your API key here>
#weathericon_ext = .asc
#fallback_type = bbsip
fallback = <system zip code>
wthrDays = <# of days you want forecast - up to 3>

Change the entry for "wungrndAPIkey = <your API key here>" by adding your API Key from Section I. 
	Example:
	wungrndAPIkey = 123456789abc1234

NOTE: No quotes are needed in the modopts.ini section you added. 
This step is now different than version 1.00, where you entered the key directly into the weather.js file. 
This makes updates to the weather.js file easier, since you don't have to edit the javascript each time an update lands.

3: If you have added custom weather icons, make sure the file extension matches in the weathericon_ext variable in modopts.ini
   Example: The app comes with .ASC icons, if you changed to .ANS icons, you would put
       weathericon_ext = .ans
   Otherwise, if you did not change the icons that came with syncWXremix, then keep the default modopts.ini entry of 
       weathericon_ext = .asc

Note: Please read section III below if you are adding a new set of custom ANSI or ASCII weather icons.
   
4: Set up the External Door via Synchornet Configuration, External Programs

Setting up the main door (weather.js):

[weather.js]
 1: Name                       Your Local Weather
 2: Internal Code              SYNCWX
 3: Start-up Directory         ../xtrn/syncWX/
 4: Command Line               ?weather.js
 5: Clean-up Command Line      
 6: Execution Cost             None
 7: Access Requirements        
 8: Execution Requirements     
 9: Multiple Concurrent Users  Yes
10: Intercept Standard I/O     No
11: Native (32-bit) Executable No
12: Use Shell to Execute       No
13: Modify User Data           No
14: Execute on Event           Logon (or "Logon" or "Logon, Only", it is up to you)
15: Pause After Execution      No (already has a pause built-in)
16: BBS Drop File Type         None
17: Place Drop File In         Node Directory
18: Time Options...

Setting up Icon Viewer:

The purpose of the iconset.js script is to see the icon files that have been designed for 
your syncWXremix app quickly and in total. This way, if you are designing your own
icon pack for the weather, you can make sure that 1) the icons look good, and 
2) you are not missing any of the icons you would need. 

Note: This is not meant to be seen by anyone but a sysop, so the access requirement
is set to LEVEL 90 (or above). Also, the icon extension is set just like in weather.js, where
it grabs the extension from /sbbs/ctrl/modopts.ini.

[iconset.js]
 1: Name                       View Icon Set
 2: Internal Code              WTHRICON
 3: Start-up Directory         ../xtrn/syncWX/
 4: Command Line               ?iconset.js
 5: Clean-up Command Line      
 6: Execution Cost             None
 7: Access Requirements        LEVEL 90
 8: Execution Requirements     
 9: Multiple Concurrent Users  Yes
10: Intercept Standard I/O     No
11: Native (32-bit) Executable No
12: Use Shell to Execute       No
13: Modify User Data           No
14: Execute on Event           No
15: Pause After Execution      No
16: BBS Drop File Type         None
17: Place Drop File In         Node Directory
18: Time Options...

III) Icon Files

When designing new icons in ANSI (.ans files), please make sure to keep the set of 
ASCII (.asc) icons in the icons folder. You can change the weathericon_ext setting 
in your /sbbs/xtrl/modopts.ini file, but if your user/caller is not ANSI capable, 
the program will fall back to the ASCII icon set automatically. Simply adding your 
ANSI icons to the icons folder and changing the weathericon_ext setting will 
override the ASCII icons for any of your ANSI capable callers. This includes ANSI 
callers who only have Mono capabilities instead of Color ANSI. If you are replacing 
the ASCII icons with new CTRL-A encoded ASCII files, then this should be just fine 
for non-ANSI callers who have TTY (Mono) ASCII Only as Synchronet will attempt to 
convert the characters for those users, but, keep in mind, if you are using 
Extended ASCII characters in your icon designs, this may not look as good to a 
non-ANSI terminal user.
